# Intro, Chapters 1 and 2

## Intro and Chapter 1

* Originally C with classes, extended from C by Bjarne Stroustrup
* Consistently one of the top 5 languages
* Lots of applications
* Distinct parts:
  * C language
  * C preprocessor
  * Classes and objects
  * Templates
  * Standard Template Library - common functionality
* First standard: C++98, followed up with C++03 bugfix
* Then C++11 in 2011, C++14 in 2014 (e.g. lambdas), C++17 in 2017
* This course is C++14, as C++17 not universally supported
* All of this course is designed for CLI execution; can be compiled on Linux, Mac, Windows using XCode, MS VisualC++, etc.
* Xcode uses clang from LLVM project, a modern and complete C++ compiler
* I was able to build and run the C++11 example on Linux easily.
